Turn Off Your TV

I loved you so much so I turned off the TV
Your red lips
I loved you so much so I closed the curtains
Your red lips
I loved you so much so I turned off the TV
Your red lips
I loved you so much so I closed the curtains
Your red lips

In my eyes, your body has the most
beautiful lines than any other lines
Your dark hair, I melt in its scent
Sometimes I imagine things
and I become greedy
When I watch TV, when I walk,
I want you all the time
I can’t suppress it, how can I just hold your hands?
Don’t sound so hard on me,
you’re the one who made me hard
I love you so much,
I wannna give you my everything
and have your everything
I want to hug you closer,
I wanna wet my body and pat your bottom

I wanna show you all night
You will cry when you see a different me from yesterday
I wanna show you all night
You’re so lovely, you always make my heart flutter baby

I loved you so much so I turned off the TV
Your red lips
I loved you so much so I closed the curtains
Your red lips
